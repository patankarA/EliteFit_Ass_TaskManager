# 1.How long did you spend on the coding test?
   I spent around 1 day on the coding test, making sure my solution was efficient, clean, and well-structured. If needed, I took some extra time for debugging or refining the logic.


# 2.Most useful feature in the latest version of JavaScript?
   Array Grouping
Array grouping simplifies the process of grouping elements in an array based on specific criteria, making data manipulation more intuitive and less error-prone.


# 3.How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever done this?
   No, I did not had experience with performance issues before. But according to my knowlege I can suggest some issues.
1.Check logs & monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Chrome DevTools).
2.Analyze API calls & database queries to find slow operations.
3.Use React Profiler to catch unnecessary re-renders.
Optimize state management & avoid excessive renders using useMemo, useCallback, and React Context.


# 4.If you had more time, what improvements would you make?
   If I had more time, I’d focus on:

1.Drag-and-drop task prioritization – Let users reorder tasks easily.
2.Task reminders & notifications – Send alerts for due tasks.
3.Performance boost – Optimize large lists with react-window for smooth rendering.


Thank you for giving me this apportunity.
